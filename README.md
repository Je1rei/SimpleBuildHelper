## üß© Integration details

| Topic | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Assembly Definition** | `SimpleBuildHelper.asmdef` (Editor platform only) keeps the code in its own DLL. |
| **No runtime code** | Entire source is inside an *Editor* folder; never enters a player build. |
| **Dependencies** | Only `UnityEditor` and standard `System.IO.Compression`. |
| **Zero init-overhead** | No `[InitializeOnLoad]` / `[DidReloadScripts]`; window logic runs only when opened. |

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap
* Enable **Delete** button in History
* Heavy-asset log based on `BuildReport.GetFiles()`
* Progress bar & coloured live status while building
